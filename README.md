## Design Process

I've chosen this idea as it was based on my previous assignment done in semester 1.

The website is based on a "bad" website, and I would revamp it to increase customer retention. A professional and clean website is said to build trust with the audience, which is important as the website is an E-Commerce website.

## Who the website is catering for? The value that it is providing to users.

The previous website had horrendous UI and UX, greatly impacting the users' ability to see, navigate and understand the information provided. The revamped website will allow all users to navigate through the website more efficiently. Since people accessing the website are looking for parts for their cars, they would want to see the information easily.

## Features

- Feature 1 - allows users to access a navigation bar on a desktop to access different parts of the website easily
- Feature 2 - On mobile, users can press the hamburger menu to open up a sidebar to access different parts of the website easily
- Feature 3 - Allows users to navigate the website without being harassed by a pop-up telling them to log in or sign up first. This would not be the case when they are on the payment page.\
- Feature 4 - Overall upgrade in terms of UI for both Desktop and Mobile versions.

## Technologies Used

Programming Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
